# gh-commitmsg

Tool idea:
- get staged changes in the git repository in the current directory
- feed the obtained data to the GitHub Models LLM to generate a conventional commit message
- display the generated commit message on the screen
- if it works well, we can provide several previous commit messages as examples for the model
